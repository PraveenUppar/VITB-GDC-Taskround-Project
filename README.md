## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

**Understanding Cloning:**

Cloning creates a local copy of the project on your computer, allowing you to work on it independently. This local copy is a mirror image of the original repository on GitHub or similar platforms.

Use Git to clone this repository into your local development environment:

```bash
https://github.com/PraveenUppar/VITB-GDC-Taskround-Project.git
```

**After Cloning**
You will see this interface in your system :

### 2. Running the Development Server

#### Frontend:

- Open a terminal or command prompt window.
- Navigate to the frontend directory:

```Bash
cd frontend
```

- Start the frontend development server :

```Bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically launch the React application on http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port) in your browser.
